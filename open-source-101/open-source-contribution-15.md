# How to Make You First Open Source Contribution Using GitHub in Under 15 Minutes
Speaker: Rizchel Dayao, IBM

Open source Technology:
-> Operating Systems
-> Programming languages 
-> Internet of Things
-> Artificial Intelligence

Lack of Open Source could cause:
-> Really expensive software
-> Control of big business 
-> Reinvation of the wheel (Existing functionality and build up on it)
-> Lack of community and collaboration
-> Limititation of technological developement

IBM Cloud and Carbon Componenets:
-> Enterprise software
-> Not open source
-> Broken down into microservices 
-> Carbon components is a componenet library and design system
-> Vanilla JS, React components and style guidelines
-> All Open Source

How did they differ: (IBM Cloud)
-> One person controlled all the code
-> No peer reviews to ensure security and accountability
-> Quality of code was bad (very confusing)

Carbon Componeents:
-> Contribution from anyone
-> Peer reviews on all contributions
-> Testing

Now IBM Cloud has:
-> A peer review system
-> At least 85% testing coverage

Benefits OS provides:
-> Cost benefits 
-> Community support
-> Quality Code

GitHub:
-> Code hosting platform for version control and collabortion
-> Uses Git
-> Pull down repo and thats where you contribute 

Finding a project to contribute:
->  Use GitHub Explore
-> Visit sites that have OS projects to contribute to

Your First Contribution:
-> Find something easy (docs, small bugs)
-> Look for specific labels: first timers only, good first issue, low hanging fruit, beginner, easy
-> Things to consider: language, project (something you will like), size

Now you find a bug and how to fix:
-> First fork the repo (takes all the code and copy it)
-> Make sure to not work on the master branch
-> Git clone 
-> Run the project 
-> Check out your branch (git checkout -b (the directory of where the file lives))
-> Fix the issue locally (makes sure to be always in the seperate branch than the master one)
-> Git status (It tells you anything you changed)
-> Git add . (all my changes to my pull request)
-> Git commit -m (add a message of what you changed)
-> git push origin
-> Create your pull request 
-> Lets tests run
-> MErge Pull request to Master

Contributor Common Pitffalls:
-> Coding standards
-> Git can be tricky
-> Document and comment your code
