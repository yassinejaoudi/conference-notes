# How to Make You First Open Source Contribution Using GitHub in Under 15 Minutes
Speaker: Rizchel Dayao, IBM

###Open source Technology:
* Operating Systems
* Programming languages 
* Internet of Things
* Artificial Intelligence

###Lack of Open Source could cause:
* Really expensive software
* Control of big business 
* Reinvation of the wheel (Existing functionality and build up on it)
* Lack of community and collaboration
* Limititation of technological developement

###IBM Cloud and Carbon Componenets:
* Enterprise software
* Not open source
* Broken down into microservices 
* Carbon components is a componenet library and design system
* Vanilla JS, React components and style guidelines
* All Open Source

###How did they differ: (IBM Cloud)
* One person controlled all the code
* No peer reviews to ensure security and accountability
* Quality of code was bad (very confusing)

###Carbon Componeents:
* Contribution from anyone
* Peer reviews on all contributions
* Testing

###Now IBM Cloud has:
* A peer review system
* At least 85% testing coverage

###Benefits OS provides:
* Cost benefits 
* Community support
* Quality Code

###GitHub:
* Code hosting platform for version control and collabortion
* Uses Git
* Pull down repo and thats where you contribute 

###Finding a project to contribute:
*  Use GitHub Explore
* Visit sites that have OS projects to contribute to

###Your First Contribution:
* Find something easy (docs, small bugs)
* Look for specific labels: first timers only, good first issue, low hanging fruit, beginner, easy
* Things to consider: language, project (something you will like), size

###Now you find a bug and how to fix:
* First fork the repo (takes all the code and copy it)
* Make sure to not work on the master branch
* Git clone 
* Run the project 
* Check out your branch (git checkout -b (the directory of where the file lives))
* Fix the issue locally (makes sure to be always in the seperate branch than the master one)
* Git status (It tells you anything you changed)
* Git add . (all my changes to my pull request)
* Git commit -m (add a message of what you changed)
* git push origin
* Create your pull request 
* Lets tests run
* MErge Pull request to Master

###Contributor Common Pitffalls:
* Coding standards
* Git can be tricky
* Document and comment your code
